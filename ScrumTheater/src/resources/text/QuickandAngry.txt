QuickandAngry
What do you get when rubber meets pavement? Burnouts! Get ready to put the pedal to the metal, and live life a quarter mile at a time. You can be quick, you can be angry, but not everyone can be both. Would you put your life one the line for the thrill? Or play it safe behind the wheel? Will speed take over, or will the love of FAMILY keep you safe?
